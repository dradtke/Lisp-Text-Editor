;;;;  Notes

;;;;  cairo-matrix-init is not defined, as we have a structure in lisp
;;;;    with an appropriate constructor
;;;;  
;;;;  cairo_identity_matrix is reset-trans-matrix
;;;;  
;;;;  functions that manipulate transformation matrices have
;;;;    trans-matrix instead of matrix in their name
;;;;
;;;;  cairo_matrix_transform_distance and cairo_matrix_transform_point
;;;;    are simply transform-distance and transform-point
;;;; 
;;;;  cairo_matrix_init is not defined, make-trans-matrix will give
;;;;    you an identity matrix

;;;;
;;;;  simple functions
