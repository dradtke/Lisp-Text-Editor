;;;; This probably seems more complicated than you want for basic font
;;;; rendering.  Well, it is.  This requires a good bit of custom
;;;; framework, but you can (presumably) get much faster font
;;;; rendering once it's in place.
;;;;
;;;; There are a number of comments below which make things less
;;;; readable, but are notable if you're using this interface.
;;;;
;;;; Of special note perhaps is GLYPH-ARRAY.  The goal of this is to
;;;; give an efficient interface to arrays of cairo_glyph_t, but
;;;; that's not really demonstrated here.  In a real app, you can
;;;; probably make a single GLYPH-ARRAY of reasonable size, and reuse
;;;; this to write out chunks of text, much like a static I/O buffer.
