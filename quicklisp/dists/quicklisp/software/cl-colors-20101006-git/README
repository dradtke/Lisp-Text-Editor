The purpose of this simple package to provide named colors that can be
used by other packages.  Each color is stored in a structure, and
named colors are defined as constants (eg +black+, +blue+, +slateblue+
etc).  Currently, the colors were converted from X11's rgb.txt, but
may be expanded in the future.  Alpha channels and HSV conversion are
supported.  The library of course doesn't depend on X11, the converted
file is included.
